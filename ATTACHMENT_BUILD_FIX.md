# Attachment Feature - Build Fix

## Issue
The PDF viewer dependency was causing a build failure:
```
Could not find com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:3.2.0-beta.1
```

## Solution
The PDF viewer library has been **commented out** in `app/build.gradle.kts` because:

1. **Not required for core functionality** - PDFs can be sent to Gemini without a preview library
2. **Optional feature** - PDF preview is a nice-to-have UI enhancement, not essential
3. **Build compatibility** - The specific version was not available in the repositories

## Current State

### ✅ Working Dependencies
```kotlin
implementation("io.coil-kt:coil-compose:2.6.0")
implementation("androidx.exifinterface:exifinterface:1.3.7")
```

### ⏸️ Commented Out (Optional)
```kotlin
// implementation("com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:2.8.2")
```

## What Works Without PDF Viewer

✅ **Full PDF attachment support**:
- Pick PDFs from file system
- Copy to cache with size validation
- Send to Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Upload to Firebase Storage

❌ **What's missing** (optional):
- PDF preview thumbnail in attachment chips
- Full-screen PDF preview before sending

## Workaround for PDF Preview

Currently, PDF attachments show a PDF icon instead of a thumbnail. This is acceptable since:
1. The filename and size are displayed
2. Users can see the PDF in their file picker before selecting
3. PDFs are successfully sent to Gemini

## Future Enhancement (Optional)

If you want PDF preview thumbnails later, you can:

1. **Option A**: Use a different PDF library (e.g., PdfRenderer API built into Android)
2. **Option B**: Fix the JitPack dependency by using the correct artifact path
3. **Option C**: Generate PDF thumbnails server-side

## Build Command

The project should now build successfully:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Next Steps

Follow the [ATTACHMENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](ATTACHMENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) to complete the integration. All core functionality is ready - the PDF preview is purely cosmetic.
